## 3D CNN Base Model Directory Overview

This folder contains all components for the baseline 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) pipeline.

### Structure and Key Files

- **`Preprocessing/`**  
  Contains scripts for dataset preparation and transformation.  
  - `eda-mat.py`: Converts the provided raw `.mat` data into a format compatible with the model input pipeline.

- **`train-3dcnn-minibatches.py`**  
  Script used to train the 3D CNN model.

- **`3dcnn-summary.py`**  
  Evaluation script that generates predictions and performance metrics across test datasets. It also visualizes the outputs for each granule.

- **`checkpoints/big_epoch_3_finished.pth`**  
  Final trained model checkpoint after three full training epochs.

- **`Results/`**  
  This directory contains the predicted validation outputs generated by `3dcnn-summary.py`. Each image file presents the model's prediction side-by-side with the corresponding ground truth.  
  - `3DCNN_results.txt`: Contains the full console output from the evaluation script, including performance metrics for each folder and overall summary statistics.  
  - `loss_plot.png`: A visual representation of the training and validation loss over the course of model training.

### Note

The `processed/` folder, which contains the fully preprocessed dataset in `.npy` format, was excluded from this repository due to size limitations on GitHub. To run the training or evaluation scripts, ensure that the expected data structure is locally available in the same format as originally generated.
