## Overview 🌟

**3DCNN+** is a two-part Python project:

1. **Data Download** (`box.py`): Fetches preprocessed NumPy data from Box.com using the Box Python SDK. 🎁
2. **Model Training** (`cnnp.py`): Trains a 3D convolutional neural network (`CubeRegressor`) on the downloaded data for voxel-based regression. 🤖

This README explains how to configure, run, and understand each script. 📝

## Prerequisites ✅

* Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
* Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` 📦

Install all requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup 🔧

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` or export before running `box.py`:

   ```bash
   export BOX_CLIENT_ID="<your_client_id>" 🔑
   export BOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_client_secret>" 🔒
   export BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN="<your_developer_token>" ⏳
   ```
2. **Project Folder ID**:

   * In `box.py`, set `project1_id` to your Box root folder ID. 📂
   * The script auto-discovers subfolders named `code` and `processed`.

## Part 1: Data Download (box.py) 📥

This script logs into Box via OAuth2 and downloads the `processed` folder (and all nested files/folders) into `./processed/`. 🗂️

Run:

````bash
python box.py
``` 🔄

Key functions:
- `get_folder_id_by_name(parent_folder_id, folder_name)`: Finds a subfolder ID by name. 🔍
- `download_folder(folder_id, local_path)`: Recursively downloads all files/subfolders. 🔄

After completion, check that `./processed/` contains `.npy` files for all bands and labels. 📂✅

## Part 2: Model Training (cnnp.py) 🏋️‍♂️
This script loads the downloaded `.npy` data, builds a 3D CNN, and trains it. 🎓

Run:
```bash
python cnnp.py
``` ⚙️

### Configuration (top of `cnnp.py`)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: samples per batch (adjust for GPU RAM). 🎛️
- `BIG_EPOCHS`: number of training epochs. 🔄
- `LEARNING_RATE`: initial learning rate. 🎚️
- `NUM_SAMPLES`: patches sampled per epoch for mini-epochs. 🎲

### Dataset 🗄️
- **`PatchDataset`** uses memory-mapped `.npy` arrays to avoid loading everything into RAM. 🧠💾
- It indexes all valid voxel coordinates and extracts 3D patches around each voxel. 🧱

### Model: `CubeRegressor` 🤖
- A simple 3D CNN with convolutional layers, pooling, adaptive pooling, and a fully connected head. 🧩

### Training Loop 🔄
1. **Compile** model with `torch.compile` for performance. ⚙️
2. **Optimizer**: `Adam` with initial `LEARNING_RATE`. 🚀
3. **Scheduler**: `ReduceLROnPlateau` on validation loss. 📉
4. **Mixed Precision**: `torch.amp.autocast` for faster, memory-efficient training. ⚡
5. **Checkpointing**: Saves weights (`.pth`) each epoch and a loss plot (`loss_plot.png`). 💾📊

### Evaluation 📊
- After training, computes MSE, MAE, and R² on the validation set and prints results. 🏁

## How It Works 🔍
1. **Authentication & Download**: `box.py` uses OAuth2 to fetch processed data from Box.com. 🔑
2. **Memory-Mapped Dataset**: Efficiently accesses large NumPy arrays without high RAM usage. 🧠💾
3. **Patch Extraction**: Returns 4D tensors `(batch, channels, D, H, W)` centered on voxels. 🧱
4. **3D CNN**: Processes each patch to output a single regression value. 🤖
5. **Training Strategy**: Large batch sizes, mini-epochs via sampling, mixed precision, and adaptive LR. 📈

## Results 📈
- **Output Directory**: `./checkpoints/` 📂
  - Model weights: `epoch_<n>.pth` 🗄️
  - Loss plot: `loss_plot.png` 📉
- **Final Metrics** (printed):
  ```text
  Validation MSE: 0.001234, MAE: 0.025678, R2: 0.9123 🏆
